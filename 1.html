	<p> This first example of HTML will show you just the basics of how HTML works. There will be nothing pretty here. There will be no organization, just a list of items, and examples of how to insert a photo, use headline styles, comments, and lists. </p>
	<p> By the way, I'm <a href="http://hanskmeyer.com"> Hans K. Meyer, <img src="http://i.imgur.com/4DmU5.jpg?1" alt="Hans K. Meyer's mug shot" /></a> a professor at the <a href="http://scrippsjschool.org">E.W. Scripps School of Journalism </a>at <a href="http://ohio.edu">Ohio University </a>. I've been at OU for almost six years. It's hard to believe time has gone by that fast.</p>
	
	<p> They classes I teach are the following: </p>
	<ul> <!-- Remember the differences between ULs and OLs. ULs get bullets. -->
		<li><strong>JOUR3140</strong>: Online Journalism Fundamentals </li>
		<li><strong>JOUR4923</strong>: Seminar in Online Journalism </li>
		<li><strong>JOUR4180</strong>: Digital Information and Innovation </li>
		<li><strong>JOUR4870</strong>: News and Information Capstone - Online Publication Design </li>
	</ul>
	<p> My five favorite things about Ohio University are the following: </p>
	<ol> <!-- OLs get numbers -->
		<li><em>The students</em>: They are so innovative and willing to work hard to learn journalism the right way. </li>
		<li><em>The campus</em>: The red brick and the green trees and grass makes for one beautiful learning atmosphere. </li>
		<li><em>The faculty</em>: I have amazing colleagues who support my research and teaching efforts and help make me a better professor. </li>
		<li><em>Court Street</em>: I don't drink, but a guy's gotta eat, amirite? </li>
		<li><em>Sports</em>: I've always been a huge sports fan, and it's nice to be be able to go to games without fighting huge traffic jams or paying a million dollars for a seat. </li>
	</ol>
