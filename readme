These are simple HTML pages and CSS files I use as examples for my JOUR3410 class at Ohio University. I use them to illustrate the following concepts:
HTML Structure
CSS Styling
Creating columns with DIVS
Adding interactive elements with javascript (downloaded from other sites)

Feel free to use any of the files however you'd like. I mostly make them available here so students can access them and use them as guides for their own projects.
