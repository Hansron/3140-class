		<p> This third example of HTML builds upon the first two by adding divisons to provide some basic organization to the page. The divs also use IDs and classes to simplify things, including some of the HTML 5 built in divs, such as <strong> <em> header</strong></em>, <strong><em>footer</strong></em> and <strong><em>nav</strong></em>.</p>
		<p> By the way, I'm <a href="http://hanskmeyer.com"> Hans K. Meyer </a>, a professor at the <a href="http://scrippsjschool.org">E.W. Scripps School of Journalism </a>at <a href="http://ohio.edu">Ohio University </a>. I've been at OU for more than years. It's hard to believe time has gone by that fast.</p>

	<div id="sidebar">
		<p> The classes I teach are the following: </p>
		<ul> <!-- Remember the differences between ULs and OLs. ULs get bullets. -->
			<li><strong>JOUR3140</strong>: Online Journalism Fundamentals </li>
			<li><strong>JOUR4923</strong>: Seminar in Online Journalism </li>
			<li><strong>JOUR4180</strong>: Digital Information and Innovation </li>
			<li><strong>JOUR4870</strong>: News and Information Capstone - Online Publication Design </li>
		</ul>
		<p> My five favorite things about Ohio University are the following: </p>
		<ol> <!-- OLs get numbers -->
			<li><em>The students</em>: They are so innovative and willing to work hard to learn journalism the right way. </li>
			<li><em>The campus</em>: The red brick and the green trees and grass makes for one beautiful learning atmosphere. </li>
			</li><em>The faculty</em>: I have amazing colleagues who support my research and teaching efforts and help make me a better professor. </li>
			<li><em>Court Street</em>: I don't drink, but a guy's gotta eat, amirite? </li>
			<li><em>Sports</em>: I've always been a huge sports fan, and it's nice to be be able to go to games without fighting huge traffic jams or paying a million dollars for a seat. </li>
		</ol>
